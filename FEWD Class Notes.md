# Git + GitHub Review

Note: Write learning objectives on board, write sections Opening, We Do, Closure



<!-- -- data-slide-title="Learning Objectives" -->
### After this class, you will be able to...
- Define a version control system (Git) and explain its benefits
- Initialize a local git repository and explain what it does for a developer
- Push local changes to a remote git repository using the GitHub app
- Pull changes from a remote git repository to a local computer using the GitHub app
- Connect local repositories to remote repositories using the GitHub app



<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" data-slide-title="GitHub" -->
# What is GitHub?


## Important Lingo
- git - a version control program that saves the state of your project's files and folders
- repository - a location in which data - typically about a project - is stored and managed
- clone - download data from the cloud to your local machine (laptop, computer, etc.)
- commit - save a version of your project to git



### What is GitHub?
- GitHub is a platform makes it easy to manage git repositories. It is now commonplace in any company that works with engineers.
- Stores files like Dropbox or Google Drive, but stores code.
- Hosts files on the internet so you can share the finished product with other people.
- GIT - the technology that Github is based on top of - was designed to allow for multiple engineers to work on the same project.



### Why Git?
- Since Git stores a history of the code, it allows developers to go back in time if something breaks.
- Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project. Much like Dropbox or Google Drive lets multiple people collaborate on the same document, Git allows this for code.
- Git tracks changes so you can see who worked on what.
- Git allows for feedback to be given on the code, which hopefully, increases code quality. Much like an editor updates a Word document using Track Changes, Git allows a similar environment.



### How to work with it
- Each GitHub project is called a **repository**. Engineers joining a team start by **cloning** the repository (or **repo**, for short).
- The main, stable version of the codebase is on the default **branch** in GitHub which is called **master**.
    - Engineers typically create new branches for certain features or portions of the code they will work on.


- As engineers are working on a project, they **add** and **commit** their changes. This establishes a saved version of a project and creates a history of what they are working on. With these saved versions, engineers are able to revert to an earlier version if an issue arises that cannot be fixed.
- If there are multiple engineers working on a project, other engineers can review the code that is committed and provide feedback.
    - *In this class, I will be giving feedback in the way of comments and rubric in GitHub*



<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" -->

- Lesson Number 1

<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" -->
# Unit 1: HTML BASICS



## Stop and Jot
How are websites related to communication?



## Conceptual Overview

**As developers, to communicate with users, we need to...**
- Understand where front-end development fits in the bigger picture
- Understand the components of a site on the front-end (html, css, JS)
- Understand where browsers fit in to the bigger picture and how to communicate with them



<!-- -- data-slide-title="Learning Objectives" -->
#### By the end of today's class, you will be able to...

- Apply HTML tags like `<html><head><!DOCTYPE html><body>` to a web page and experiment with html tags
- Describe the DOM and draw a simple DOM tree
- Describe how the internet displays web pages through the browser
- Create and link an external style sheet



<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" -->
## Agenda

1. Conceptual overview and background of HTML & CSS
2. Review HTML Tags & CSS Selectors
3. Practice adding structure using HTML (code-along)
4. Practice adding an External Stylesheet to the html (code-along)
5. Lab Time (independent practice)



## Workflow Routine!

- Pull from Repo
- Open up your FEWD project in Atom on one half of your screen
- Open up Google Chrome  in the other half



<!-- -- data-slide-title="Conceptual Overview" -->
## What is web development?

- The creation and management of both websites and web-based applications
- Made up of the Front-end and Back-end
- Some developers will try to convince you that it is magic, but it is mainly editing text files (coding / programming), and solving problems



![](../img/extra/01/webd.png)



## What is the front end?

- The Front-end is what the user sees
- It powers the visuals and interactions of the web
- It is meant to be pretty, but doesn't always happen that way
- Made up of HTML, CSS and Javascript



## What is the backend?

- It is what goes on behind the scenes
- Consists of databases, servers etc.
- Lots of different languages can be used, like:
  - Ruby (Ruby on Rails)
  - Javascript (Node.js)
  - PHP
  - Python
  - C++
  - ..and more



### Components of the front-end

**HTML**
defines the content (the bones)

**CSS**
assigns the style (the skin)

**JavaScript**
adds the functionality (the brain)



![](../../img/extra/jsvenn.jpg)



![](../../img/extra/htmlcssjsstack.jpg)



## Structure vs Style

- content (text, images, datasets) = steel
- content with markup (HTML code) = frame
- content with markup & css = painted vehicle

![TBL ](../../img/extra/tbl.jpg)

Note: image retrieved from http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0822572737.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg on 4/11/15



### 1989: TBL created HTML as the web's publishing language at CERN

- Tim was trying to solve the problem of loss of information
- HyperText existed but only on one computer (ability to link one document to another)
- TCP/IP existed (transportation system for data)
- Domain Name System existed (phonebook of computer addresses )

Note:
- Tim Berner's-Lee coupled HyperText idea with the TCP/IP protocols
- Credited with creating **HTTP** and **HTML** which conventions for computers to talk to each other and for developers to style websites - to aid global communication http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/book4/ch02.html



### The Inspiration
- Tim imagined what it would be like to combine HyperText idea with the Internet so you could jump from one document on one machine, to another document on another

*What would this look like if everybody could contribute and access these documents?*



<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" data-slide-title="Some History" -->
# A world wide web



## Tim's proposal

<iframe width="100%" height="400px" src="http://info.cern.ch/Proposal.html"></iframe>



## Tim's Proposal

Tim knew there needed to be a
-  shared method for sending/receiving data across the web
-  common convention for structuring the data

To achive this, he created `http` and `html`



### First website

### HyperText Markup Language

- **HyperText**: text which contains links to other texts
- **Markup**: a semantic way to describe a document separate from its content

`<h1>Hello!</h1>`

# Big Picture
### **When you click a link...**


![](../../img/extra/internet.jpg) <!-- .element style="width: 685px;" -->

Note:
http://orig08.deviantart.net/6908/f/2010/126/c/1/internet_diagram_by_wes2299.jpg
- You are asking your computer to retrieve a particular **file**, from a particular **server**, using a particular **protocol**
- It requests the IP address from a **D**omain **N**ame **S**ervice server
  - It does this by sending a **packet** of information (destination, origin, subect, content)
- Computer sends it down ethernet or wifi to another computer (likely cable company), then another...until it reaches its destination (**Internet Protocol**), which then sends back a response ( the requested file )
- All information is broken into packets when it leaves and are reassembled when received (**T**ransmisision **C**ontrol **P**rotocol)


## When you click a link
- Your computer receives a response which is html
- Browser reads the HTML and displays it to us

Note: show curl http://www.google.com



<!-- -- data-background-color="#000" -->
## Let's start coding!

- Go ahead and open Atom and Google Chrome

# HTML Anatomy
### Overview of HTML



### **Elements** - building blocks

![HTML Syntax](../../img/unit_1/tags.png)
Note:
- element vs. attribute
- Most tags have opening and closing tag
  - exceptions include those that don't have nested content
    `img, input, br, hr`
- Some tags require an attribute like the <link> tag - we'll use later to bring in a SS



### **Attributes** - additional info about elements

![HTML Syntax](../../img/unit_1/tags_attributes.png)



### Headings

```
<h1> . . . </h1> <!-- most important heading -->
<h2> . . . </h2>
<h3> . . . </h3>
<h4> . . . </h4>
<h5> . . . </h5>
<h6> . . . </h6> <!-- least important heading -->
```
Note:
- Let's took a look at some common tags
- When may we want to use different sized headings?


### Text Elements
```
    <p>This is a paragraph</p>

    <code>This is some computer code</code>
```
Note:
- markup is about annotating our content
- notice how the tags are describing the type of content enclosedâ€¦this idea is reinforced with HTML5, semantic markup


### Unordered list

```
<ul></ul> -> unordered list element
<li></li> -> list element

<!-- Used together like this... -->

<ul>
    <li>List item 1</li> <!-- an example of one tag in another -->
    <li>List item 1</li>
    <li>List item 1</li>
</ul>
```


### Links (Anchor)

```
 <a href="#">Link</a>
```



### HTML Structure Review
What is the basic structure of an HTML document?

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`
- `<html>`
  - `<head>`
    - `<title></title>`
  - `</head>`
  - `<body>`
  - `</body>`
- `</html>`


```
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- tells browser which version of HTML -->
<html>        <!-- root element of the document -->
  <head>        <!-- important information, but not visible content goes here -->
    <title></title>     <!-- only required element in the head -->
  </head>
  <body>         <!-- contains our visible content -->
   <!-- content goes here -->
  </body>
</html>

```
Note:
Let's add this structure to the FEWD Outline document



<!-- -- data-slide-title="Intro to DOM" data-background-color="#000" -->
# Document Object Model (DOM)



### What is the DOM?
*The HTML DOM is an application programming interface (api) that defines*:

- The HTML elements as **objects**
- The **properties** of all HTML elements
- The **methods** to access all HTML elements
- The **events** for all HTML elements

In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to **get**, **change**, add, **or** **delete** HTML elements.



### Document Object Model
It represents elements as a hierarchy of nodes

### Let's play around with this stuff

| CSS Property          | CSS Value options (choose one) |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| background            | blue, green, red, yellow, black|
| font-size             | 12px, 16px, 18px, 24px         |
| color  (*font color*) | blue, green, red, yellow, black|

## INDEPENDENT PRACTICE!
![GeneralAssemb.ly](../../img/icons/exercise_icon_md.png)



### Cookie Recipe

> Here's the situation...
>
> You have come across your grandma's recipe for chocolate chip cookies...but there is a problem!  The recipe has no structure or styling!
> Your challenge is to:

- Use HTML tags to add structure (use whatever tags you think are best!)
- Use CSS to add style to achieve the desired look described in the readme.md

- Apply and explain CSS "cascade" including: ***importance***, ***specificity*** and **inheritance**.
- Predict image paths and apply **relative** paths to ```<img>``` and ```<a>```
- Experiment with ***margin*** and ***border***


## Agenda
*   Exit tickets
*   HTML tag review, Drawing the DOM
*   What tag is it? Exercise
*   Our first site, code-along
   * structure
     * css styling
     * page & stylsheet linking
*   Lab time - time to work on your first site!



## Exit ticket review
***Would love to have a tag cheatsheet to know which tags to use when.***

I have added a link to a tag cheetsheet to our repo. I have also added a link to MDN's quick tag reference.


## Exit ticket review
***How do I host my page and link to non-local resources?***

- We will be going over linking non-local resoruces today.
- I will add a link to hosting HTML on github pages to the resources for tonights class. We will all learn how to host our projects on GitHub pages for our final project.



## Stop and Jot!

From what you know so far, how is HTML like a family tree or hierarchy?

## What tag is it?

![GA code-along](../../img/icons/code_along.png)


## Tag Research

Take 5 minutes,

- go to Mozilla Developer Network (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) and research the following tags:

```
<nav>, <img>, <hr>, <footer>
```

-  If you finish before the time is up, go to a website you regularly visit, view its page source (option+command+u), and look for 3 elements you have never seen



## What Tag is it?

Open up the `homework-portfolio` assignment in your workspace folder.

We are going to go ahead and practice looking at a mockup, and creating the structure of a web page!

---
If at any point today, you want an extra challenge, there is a bonus challenge in the *css_concert* folder!


## HTML and CSS

![](../../img/icons/code_along.png)
Note:


### Images

Images are placed using

	<img>


### Images

	<img src="img/imageName.jpg" alt="alternative text">

The `img` tag requires a `src` attribute, which tells the browser where to find the image.


### Images

How would you write the src?

![](../../img/unit_1/folder_structure.png)

Inside ```webroot``` (folder the website resides),
a relative path could be used:
`<img src="images/logo.png">`
<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:
ask them to write path on their desk


### Images
Relative Path

![Parent Folder Structure](../../img/unit_1/folder_structure_parentDirectory.png)

Given this folder structure the, same image would be

`<img src="../images/logo.png">`<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Note:
that ```..``` means to go up a directory, and can be used repeatedly: `../..` would go up two directories.


### Images

Site-root relative

	<img src="/images/logo.png">

Note:
	Site-root relative URLs start with a `/`, so if we imagine that our `webroot` directory was stored on a server such that the `webroot/index.html` file is accessible at `http://example.com/index.html`, then placing the logo image could be done from any html page with: ```<img src="/images/logo.png">```

	The benefit here is that this same ```src``` path works on any html page, no matter what its location, so the same ```img``` tag can be used on both the ```webroot/index.html``` page and the ```webroot/about/index.html``` page.

	The downside is that the path only works if the project is stored to a proper location for serving.


### HTML Basics - Images
Absolute URL

		<img src="https://ga-core.s3.amazonaws.com/production/uploads/program/default_image/397/thumb_User-Experience-Sketching.jpg">

Note:
For linking to images, make sure that you have permission to use the image in this way. Even then, it is often better to host a copy of the same image, rather than link to another server, because it reduces dependency.


### HTML Basics - Images

`alt` attribute

	<img src="puppy.jpg" alt="My cute puppy">


### HTML Basics - Images

***alt*** attribute

A piece of text to be used in lieu of the image when the image is unavailable

Note:
Using `alt` attributes has the added benefit of giving search engines more linguistic context about the image as it is used on your page.

Reasons an image may not load:

* There was a connection error, the browser didn't download the image.

* The file was not found, perhaps because the image got moved elsewhere and the page wasn't updated yet to reflect the change.

* The user is running a text-based browser such as an older phone with a WAP-style browser, or a non-graphical browser like lynx.

* The user is using a screen reader because she has low vision, which will read the `alt` text aloud or present it through a braille reader.



### HTML
There are three main image file formats:
* .png
* .gif
* .jpg


### Image File Formats
#### .png

- Lossless compression
- Supports transparency and semi-transparency, great for logos, icons, and repeating background tiles.
- Almost always preferable to a `gif`, unless semi-transparency is not needed, and the `gif` format is significantly smaller.


### Image File Formats
#### .gif

*	Can have basic transparency, typically a `png` is used instead.


### Image File Formats
#### .jpeg

- No transparency, can be stored at different compression levels with varying amounts of "lossy-ness"
- Typically the best format for photos. (Try to balance between photo quality and file size.)



### CSS Benefits (review)

- **Global changes** - multiple pages can share same stylesheets
- **Adaptable design** - allows same content to have different styles, based on rendering method (screen, print)
- **Adaptable design** - same content can appear differently on different size screens (desktop, tablet, phone)
- **Accessibility** - users can override site's style (need larger font, different colors etc)


### CSS Syntax

![](../../img/unit_1/css_syntax.png)

![](../../img/extra/cssrule.gif)


## CSS

### Where does CSS go?

* Inline
* In the `head`
* In a separate file

*We have been working with external files, though we could also put it in two other locations*


## CSS

### Where does CSS go?

We could put it directly in the head of our HTML file

	<head>
		<style type="text/css">
		body{
			color:red;
		}
		</style>
	</head>


## CSS

### Where does CSS go?

Or directly on an element, using the 'style' attribute

This method is called "inline" because the css is in the line of html code

	<body style="color:red;">

	</body>


## CSS

### Using a separate CSS file

Its usually best practice to put CSS in its own file and link to it from the `<head>`

	<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
	</head>

Note:
"The `link` tag needs two attributes: `rel="stylesheet"` and an `href` attribute.

The `href` attribute value works very similarly to linking to an image, or to another page.



## CSS Break Down

This whole thing is called a **rule**.

```
p {
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

*  The `p` is called a **selector**, and it's followed by a set of **declarations** in a **declaration block**.
*  The **selector** specifies what parts of the HTML document should be styled by the declaration.
*  This selector will style all `p` elements on the page


## CSS Break Down

The **declaration block** here is:

```
{
	color: red;
	font-weight: bold;
}
```

**Declarations** go inside curly braces.


## CSS Break Down
### Declarations

This example has two declarations. Here's the first:

```
color: red;
```

Every declaration is a **property** followed by a **value**, separated by a colon, ending in a semicolon.

In this declaration, we are setting the `color` **property** to the **value** `red`.

Note: Resource: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax
---


## CSS Break Down

Let's look at the second declaration:

```
font-weight: bold;
```

Note:

What style **property** are we specifying here?

What **value** are we setting that **property** to?

Try writing a new set of styles for another element, like an `h1`.



## CSS Break Down
Linking multiple pages to an external file allows us to re-use the rules on multiple pages


### **Cascading** Style Sheets
#### So far, we have seen HTML be styled by:
1. user-agent<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> (the browser)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
2. user<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="8" --> (e.g. larger font for somebody with poor eyesight)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="" -->
3. author of the website <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->(you)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
   - in the html file directly<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> (within the ```<head></head>``` tags)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
   - external .css file<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
   - inline <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" --> ```<p style="color:blue;">My paragraph text</p>```<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="7" -->

These are called <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="9" -->**origins**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="10" -->

Note:
These are called origins
<link> or @import for external


## The Cascade

***If css rules can be defined all over the place, how does the  browser know which to use?***

Note: Resource: https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/specs.en.html


### What style gets applied?

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<style>
		p {
	    color: red;
	  }

	  p {
	    color: blue;
	  }
	</style>
  <title>Sample CSS Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This is a paragraph<!-- .element: class="highlight-blue fade-in fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->

because the second style comes after the first<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


### What style gets applied?

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<style>

		p {
		  color: red;
		}

		p span {
		  color:green;
		}

		p {
		  color: blue;
		}

	</style>
	<title>Sample CSS Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>This is a <span>paragraph</span></p>
</body>
</html>
```
This is a paragraph<!-- .element: class="highlight-green fade-in fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

Because the second style is more specific than the others<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->


### Why is this this case?
The CSS specification describes a priority scheme, called ***The Cascade***, which determines which style rules apply if **more than one rule** matches against a partiular **element**

Note: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets


### "Cascading" Style Sheets (CSS)
The **CSS cascade** is the **process** that **determines what style gets applied** to what element.  A **weight is assigned** to **each declaration** by factoring in:

- importance <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> (...I know we haven't yet)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- origin <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->(user-agent, user, author)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- specificity <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->(previous example)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- the source order<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> (we just saw an example of this)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


### Normal vs Important Declarations
---
!important declarations written like this

```

p {
  color: blue!important;  //This rule is applied because it is !important
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```


### "Cascading" Style Sheets (CSS)
The **CSS cascade** is the **process** that **determines what style gets applied** to what element.  A **weight is assigned** to **each declaration** by factoring in:

- importance
- origin <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->(user-agent, user, author)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- specificity <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- the source order<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> (makes sense)<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->


### Cascading" Style Sheets (CSS)
This ***weight*** is used to determine exactly, and without ***conflict***, which style **declarations** should be applied to a specific ***element***:

the ***declaration with the highest weight takes precedence***

![css cascade](../../img/extra/csscascade.jpg)

Note:
http://www.gdsw.at/languages/html/webstyle/wsg3/figures/5-site-structure/5-5-700.jpg


### Importance/origin

Rules can have `!important` added to the end of them, this makes them higher priority.

Order of priority:

---

1. user agent declarations
2. normal declarations in user style sheets
3. normal declarations in author style sheets
4. important declarations in author style sheets
5. important declarations in user style sheets

Note: taken from http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/css-specificity-and-inheritance/ on 10/15/15


### Process of resolution if rules conflict

Browser goes through **four steps** to determine which declaration "**wins**"

1. **Identifies** all declarations that apply to a **specific element**
2. Sorts declarations according to their levels of  **importance** and **origins**
3. Sorts declarations with the same level of importance and origin by selector **specificity**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
4. If declarations have the same level of importance, origin, and specificity, it sorts them by the order in which they're specified and **the last declaration wins**<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->

Note:
http://www.sitepoint.com/web-foundations/cascade/


## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that's separate from the cascade:
- inheritance applies to the DOM (Document Object Model) tree
- the cascade deals with the style sheet rules.

However, CSS properties set on an element via the cascade can be inherited by that element's child elements.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

- Not all properties are inherited (e.g. borders), but some are (e.g. color).<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

The list is availabe at<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> http://developer.mozilla.org<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

Note: http://reference.sitepoint.com/css/inheritance


## Inheritance example

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  body {
    color: red;
  }

  <title>Sample CSS Page</title>
</head>
<body>
	<p>This is a paragraph</p>
</body>
</html>
```
This is a paragraph<!-- .element: class="highlight-red fade-in fragment" data-fragment-index="1"-->

### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
#### Colors

Colors can be specified in CSS in a variety of ways:

![](../../img/unit_1/color.png)

Note:
* keyword
* hex codes
* rgb
* hsl
* rgba
* hsla


## Color
### Color Keywords

These are used less frequently, but are handy for basic colors like `black` and `white`. There are several


## Color
### Hex Codes (RGB)

![Hex Color explanation](../../img/unit_1/hex_colors.png)

Note:
* they use hexadecimal, or base-16, to describe the color values for red, green, and blue.
* Each of the 3 color values is expressed by two hexadecimal digits, from `00` (no color) to `FF` (full color), and are written in the order red, green, then blue, after an initial `#` sign.
* Hex values can be abbreviated to only 3 digits if each digits is doubled. So `#FFFFFF` (white) can be expressed more succinctly as `#FFF`, and `#000000` (black) can be expressed as `#000`. `#FA6198`, however, cannot be abbreviated without altering the color.
* Hex to decimal ref: http://hextodecimal.com/index.php?hex=FF


## Color
### RGB Color Values

#### ```rgb(0,0,0)```

*	The first value is red, the second green, the third blue.

Note:
* Each value can range from 0 to 255, which expresses the same number of color steps as 00 to FF in base-16.
* FF in base-16 is equivalent to 255 in base-10.
* In RGB, `rgb(0,0,0)` is black, `rgb(255,255,255)` is white, `rgb(255,0,0)` is red, etc.
* White-space is allowed *inside* the parentheses, so `rgb(255, 0, 0)` will do just as well.


![](../../img/unit_1/rgba_color.png)

### RGBa Colors
*	RGBa works identically to RGB, expect that it takes a 4th value called the "alpha".
   * This is a value between 0 and 1 which will be used to determine a color's opacity on the page


### RGBa Colors
0 is completely transparent, and 1 being solid. 0.5 or .5 is 50% opacity.

Thus, __rgba(0,0,0,.25)__ is black at 25% opacity and __rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)__ is white at 80% opacity.

The alpha value can be in decimal form but cannot use a percentage. When a decimal is used, the leading zero is optional.


### HSL Colors
*	Similar notation to RGB values, but specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness.


### HSLa
*	As with RGBa, HSLa is exactly like HSL for the first 3 values, but takes a 4th alpha-channel value.

Note:
### HSL Colors
- **Hue** is expressed as a degree angle measure, with red being at 0, green at 120, and blue at 240. Note that the degree unit is implied, and that the angle wraps around, so 360 also refers to red, and -120 is the same as 240 (blue).
- **Saturation** is expressed as a percentage, with 100% being a fully saturated color, and 0% being a shade of gray (no hue).
- **Lightness** is also expressed as a percentage, 0% being black, and 100% being white. 50% lightness is the "normal" color range: anything above 50% gives a white tint, anything below 50% gives a black shade.

As an example, red is ```hsl(0, 100%, 50%)```, which is equivalent to ```#FF0000```.

Note that changing the opacity allows whatever colors are "behind" an element to shine through, which can alter the visible color significantly, especially at lower opacities.

## Exit ticket review
> For inline styles (e.g. different fonts in the resume), is the best practice a span and class assignment or is this best handled with H tags or otherwise?

Both methods can be used. For elements that a semantic meaning fits, you would want to use that tag. For others, you can use a `span` tag, which doesn't have any semantic meaning with a class to style that portion of text.


## Conceptual Breakdown
How do all the pieces we've covered fit together?



## Box Model
#### Think, pair, share

take 1 minute to independently brainstorm what you remember from the reading on box model, then discuss with your partner


## Box Model
**<u>Fundamental web development concept:</u>**

**every element on a page is a rectangular box** and may have ***width***, ***height***, ***padding***, ***borders***, and ***margins***

---

EVERY ELEMENT ON THE PAGE IS A BOX!

## Tags & Boxes exercise
**Open up tags_boxes.html in your workspace folder**


## Box model exercise
**Open up 03_box_model.html in your workspace folder**


### How are boxes measured?

![box model example](../../img/extra/box-sample.png)


**Total width**

margin-left + border-left + padding-left + content + padding-right + border-right + margin-right = 490px;

**Total height**   - calculated the same way



## Box Model

1. Update the CSS we just did for `section`
2. Assign the appropriate values to your css to match the dimensions in the image and:
3. The **content** should be **300px wide**, **200px tall** and the border should be **5px wide**)

### What determines the width of content?
It depends on the **display** type of the particular element

![](../../img/extra/example-blockinline2.jpg)


## **Block** elements
*elements with `display:block;` by default*

------

- Start on a new line
- By default, they take up all available width

**Examples?**

`<p> - pargraph`
`<h1>-<h6> - headings`
`<div> - generic block container`


### Display: block - what is adjustable?

| CSS Property | Is the value adjustable? |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| Width        | Yes                      |
| Height       | Yes                      |
| Padding      | Yes                      |
| Margin       | Yes                      |


### Inline elements
*elements with `display:inline` by default*

------

- Do not start on a new line
- Its width is determined by its content

**Examples?**

`<span> - generic inline container`

`<img> - image`

`<a> - link`


### Display: inline - what is adjustable?

| CSS Property | Is the value adjustable?                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Width        | **No**                                   |
| Height       | **No**, an alternative is `line-height`  |
| Padding      | **Yes** (left/right), **Yes, but will not affect neighboring content** (top/bottom) |
| Margin       | **Yes** (left/right), **Yes, but will not affect neighboring content** (top/bottom) |


### Display type

## **Inline block**
---
`*display:inline-block*`
- Display inline, like an inline element
- Its box can be adjusted like a block element


## `inline-block`

# Intro to Programming - Week 4



### Introduction To Programming

#### "The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity"

*`-` Haverbeke, M. (2014). Eloquent Javascript. No Starch Press.*


## Learning Objectives

- Practice programmatic thinking by writing pseudocode to solve a basic problem
- Define web site behavior and the practical uses of JavaScript
- Predict DOM output/changes by reading JS code


### Programming is about solving problems:

##### Introduction to Programming

- How do I conditionally show/hide this piece of content?
- How do I ensure a user submits a valid email when they fill out this form?
- How can I display this massive set of data in a meaningful, stunning way?
- How can I allow people to communicate and collaborate in real-time?


### What is a Program?

A __program__ is a set of instructions that you write to tell a computer what to do


### What is Programming?

__Programming__ is the task of writing those instructions in a language that the computer can understand.


### Becoming a Programmer

- It is less about learning a language, and more about changing how one thinks.
- For this change to take place, one has to know how the computer thinks


### How do computers think?

##### (not factoring in AI, machine-learning algorithms etc.)

- The short answer is that  **they don't think.**
- While computers don't think, they act as if they do, by sequentially executing simple instructions.
- The only things a computer knows are the things we tell it
- And it can do those things  **really**  **really** **quickly**


### How do we tell it what to do?

**We give it step-by-step instructions**

![](../../img/extra/cookierecipe.png)


### Introduction To Programming
#### How do we figure out the instructions?

***Pseudocode***

- Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.


### Pseudo Code

- Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs

example: *If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door*



### Thermostat Pseudocode

![GeneralAssemb.ly](../../img/icons/code_along.png)


##### helpful questions to ask while pseudocoding

- What is the problem I am trying to solve?
- What is the goal?
- Who or what is involved?
- What does the solution look like?
- What variables are involved?
- Will this solution work under all conditions?
- If not, how can we adapt it so it does?


### Pseudocode Practice

##### Independent practice - 10 minutes

Find space on a wall...do your best to independently pseudocode one or more of these items

- A vending machine that sells one item
- A microwave without preset options (user input only)
- A toaster
- A vending machine that sells multiple items
- A microwave with built-in prets (popcorn, +30 sec etc.)

![GeneralAssemb.ly](../../img/icons/exercise_icon_md.png)


### Rock Paper Scissors

##### Psuedocode a program that can play rock, paper, scissors with you

**You are the computer.**

What steps do you need to be provided in order to allow a person to play rock, paper, scissors with you?

- Person has a controller with 3 buttons
- The moment they press one, you have the ability to respond to that action



## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website

Note:
(for example: games, responses when buttons are pressed or data entered in forms, dynamic styling, animation).

## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript (JS) was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
- JS has made modern web applications possible--applications with which you can interact directly, without doing a page reload for every action.
- JS has almost nothing to do with the programming language named Java.

### Remember the HTML DOM?

The HTML DOM is a standard **object** model and **programming interface** for HTML.

It defines:

- The HTML elements as  **objects**
- The  **properties** of all HTML elements
- The  **methods**  to access all HTML elements
- The  **events**  for all HTML elements

*The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements*

Note: taken from http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_methods.asp on 5/12/16


## The DOM API

The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages) through the DOM API (application programming interface)

In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as  **objects**

The DOM API is the collection of  **properties**  and **methods** of each object.

A  **property**  is a value that you can get or set (like changing the content of an HTML element).

A  **method**  is an action you can do (like add or deleting an HTML element).

Note: taken from http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp on 5/12/16


### JS Objects, Properties, Methods

![](../../img/extra/js_object.png)


### The Dom & Javascript

The purpose of the DOM is to provide a programatic interface for **manipulating** this live document using JavaScript.

![](../../img/extra/domtree.gif)

note: taken from  http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1  on 5/12/16 http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp


### The DOM & JS

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page

note: taken from  http://domenlightenment.com/#1.1  on 5/12/16 http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp


### What can that look like?

### **What will we be doing with JS?**

- Using it as the context to learn fundamental programming concepts (e.g. control flow, variables, functions )
- Using it to respond to user actions
  - button clicks, mouseovers etc)
- Manipulating the DOM
  - hiding/showing elements, changing CSS property values
- Exploring a library called jQuery which is built on JavaScript

## Traffic light example

#### Where have we seen these?

http://codepen.io/barryross/pen/RaOajB


### Is there an easier way to do all of this ?

Let's look at how jQuery can help


## Javascript example

```
document.getElementById('grayButton').onclick = switchGray;
document.getElementById('whiteButton').onclick = switchWhite;
document.getElementById('blueButton').onclick = blueButton;
document.getElementById('greenButton').onclick = greenButton;

function switchGray() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'gray';
 document.body.style.color = 'white';
}

function switchWhite() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'white';
  document.body.style.color = 'black';
}

function blueButton() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'blue';
  document.body.style.color = 'black';
}

function greenButton() {
  document.body.style.backgroundColor = 'green';
  document.body.style.color = 'black';
}
```


## jQuery Example

```
$("#grayButton").click(switchGray)
function switchGray(){
  $("body").css(
    {"backgroundColor":"gray", color:"white"}
  )
}

$("#whiteButton").click(switchWhite)
function switchWhite(){
  $("body").css(
    {"backgroundColor":"white", color:"black"}
  )}

$("#blueButton").click(blueButton)
function switchBlue(){
  $("body").css(
    {"backgroundColor":"blue", color:"black"}
  )}

$("#greenButton").click(greenButton)
function switchGreen(){
  $("body").css(
    {"backgroundColor":"green", color:"black"}
  )}
```



### Intro to jQuery

jQuery provides the jQuery() function which lets us select elements using CSS selectors (and some unique to jQuery)

```
jQuery('li') //selects all <li>s on the page

it can be re-written as

$('li')
```

Note:
valid var names do not begin with numbers and don't contain hyphens http://jqfundamentals.com/chapter/jquery-basics https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/


### Intro to jQuery
#### What is it?

- jQuery is a JavaScript library (pre-written code that allows for easier development)  
- jQuery is written in JavaScript
- jQuery is cross-browser compatible
- jQuery makes DOM manipulation simple
- Document traversal (document-tree cherry picking)
- CSS Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Animation
- and more!


### Intro to jQuery
#### Adding jQuery to your website
##### jQuery.com

<iframe src="https://jquery.com/" width="800" height="400">


### Adding jQuery to your website
#### Linking to a local copy of jQuery.js

```
<script src="js/jquery-1.8.3.min.js"></script>
```


### Adding jQuery to your website
##### Linking to an external file (CDN)

### Intro to jQuery
#### Let's start using it!

- Examples
- Traffic light switcher code-along


## Syntax

__Syntax:__ Spelling and grammar rules of a programming language.

Note:
Like with any language, there are formal rules around how to write it. This is the syntax.


### jQuery syntax is like JS syntax
#### (for the most part)

- Semicolon
- Brackets
- Parentheses
- Quotation Marks


### Javascript

```
document.getElementById('uniqueObject').onclick = doSomething;

function doSomething(){
	alert("I am doing something ");
}
```

### jQuery

```
$("#uniqueObject").click(doSomething);

function doSomething(){

	alert("I am doing something ");
	}
```


### jQuery syntax is like JS syntax
#### Comments are the same

```
//Single Line Comments
```

```
/* Multi line comments /*
```



## jQuery Syntax - Selectors

Selectors are just like CSS

```
Selecting an element by its class -> $(".class").click();

Selecting an element by its id -> $("#id").click();
```

```
$('.class').click(doSomething);
function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}

$('#id').click(doSomething);
function doSomething() {
	// make something happen here
}
```

Note:
We will certainly be discussing this in more detail, but in general jQuery letâ€™s us grab some element from the page ($('slector')), and do something with it ($('selector').click(doSomething);). In this case, we grabbed an element with the id thingy and used .click() to make a function run when the user clicks on #thingy.


## jQuery Click Event
### .click()

```
	$('#uniqueObject').click(doSomething);

	function doSomething() {
		// make something happen here
   	}
```

Can also be written shorthand, like this:

```
 	$('#uniqueObject').click(function(){
  	//make something happen here
	});
```


### jQuery - how does it all work?
![](../../img/extra/jquery-how-it-works.gif)


### Some jQuery Functions

```
.click()
.slideToggle()
.hide()
.show()
.slideUp()
.slideDown()
.children()
.attr()
```

## jQuery Traffic Light

Note:

- Download jQuery library
- Add it after index.js


- change `<p>` tags to have the text display white
- change size of all the boxes
- make purple box bigger than the rest
- prevent link from its default behavior
- When the blue box is clicked, make the purple one disappear
- When the red box is clicked, make the purple appear again

**More difficult:**

- Create 2 new boxes , one yellow and one orange.  (hint: lookup after() or before() or *append()*)
- When the "Do Something" button is clicked, make the orange box slide up and disappear,

## jQuery Review - FAQ exercise

- Pseudocode the process
- Begin coding based off of what kicks the process off
- Fill in the login/blanks
- Test under different conditions!
- Can we improve (shorten, make less redundant, more efficient) our code?


## Variables

What are variables?

A __variable__ is a symbolic name or representation of information

Note:
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html


### Variables: Outside of computing

** Where are some everyday examples of where we use variables?**

- **She** is becoming a better web developer (pronouns)
- Want to meet me for **dinner**? (the value of dinner can vary, but "dinner" gives us something concrete to reference in the meantime)


## Stop and Jot
---
Take 1-2 minutes and **independently** brainstorm (on your desk) examples of ways we use *variables* (placeholders) to make everyday communication, planning or problem-solving easier?


## Variables

A __variable__ is a symbolic name or representation of information


### Variables - what value do they provide?

*  Allow us to write flexible programs that work with different data sets
   *  thermostat works with any <code>desiredTemp</code> and <code>currentTemp</code>
   *  rock, paper, scissors program works when:
```
         userInput = rock;
         userInput = paper;
         userInput = scissors;
```


## Variables

- We can tell our program to remember values for us to use later on.
- The action of saving a value to memory is called __assignment__
- The entity we use to store the value is called a __variable__


## Variables

* The action of getting the value from a variable is called __accessing__ the variable
* We will use all the above techniques to store values into variables, and generate new values using existing variables


## Variable Declaration

Declaration:
```
var age;
```
Assignment:
```
age = 30;
```

Both at the same time:
```
var age = 30;
```


## Variable Re-Assignment
```
var name = "James";
```

```
name = "Joe";
```

Note: name is now Joe.


## Variable Conventions

*	Variables start with a lower case letter
- If they contain multiple words, subsequent words start with an upper case letter.
```
var numberOfStudents = 10;
```
Note:
Go back to code-along now


## Variables & Data Types

What can you store in a variable?


## Data Types

The types of different values JavaScript supports include:
* Text -> **String**
* Numbers -> Integer (**int**) or Decimals (**float**)
* True/False -> **Boolean**


## Strings

* Store textual information
* A string literal is surrounded by quotes
```
"How is the weather today?"
'Warm'
```


## Strings

Double vs single quoted strings:

	'They "purchased" it'

	"It's a beautiful day"


## Strings

Escaping
```
"They \"purchased\" it"

'It\'s a beautiful day'
```


## Conversion: String To Number
	var intString = "4";
	var intNumber = parseInt(intString, 10);
	var floatString = "3.14159";
	var floatNumber = parseFloat(floatString);

Note:
Why would you need to convert datatypes?
Numbers are strings and you want to add them together...javascript converts most things to strings so often need to do this when working with the DOM


## Conversion: Number To String
```
	var number = 4;
	number.toString(); => "4"

	number + ""; => "4"

```

Note:
Why would you need to convert datatypes?


## Numbers
Represent numerical data

Number:         42

Number:      3.14159265


## Numbers

Signed

Number:         +6

float:      -8.2

Can perform arithmetic on number data types

Helpful questions for pseudo code solution

* What is the problem/goal?
* Who or what is involved?
* What functions may need to be created/used?
* What variables are involved (what changes in various situations/conditions)?
* Will this solution work under all conditions?  If not, how can we adapt it so it does?



## Conditionals

![](../../img/unit_1/cfDiagram.png)


## Making Decisions

It's either TRUE or FALSE (like booleans)

If you are greater than 18
you are an adult

	if (age > 18){
		document.write("You are an adult");
	}


## Comparisons - Equality

Are two things equal?

```
10 === 10 //true
10 === 5 //false
"hi" === "hi" //true
```

## Conditional Syntax

```
if(condition is true) {  
	//Do cool stuff
}
```


## Conditional Syntax
```
	if(condition is true) {
		//Do cool stuff
	}else{
		//Do other cool stuff
	}
```


## Conditional Syntax
```
	var topic = "JS";

	if (topic === "JS") {
		console.log("You're learning JavaScript");
	} else if(topic === "JavaScript") {
		console.log("You're still learning JavaScript");
	} else {
	    console.log("You're learning something else");
    }
```


## Multiple Conditions

```
if (name === "GA"  && password === "YellowPencil"){
	//Allow access to internet
}
```

## Temp Converter - User Story

From a user's perspective, what would a functional application that takes celsius temperature, converts it to Fahrenheit and changes the background to reflect the temperature look like?


## Temp Converter - Pseudocode


## Temp Converter
Code the function that converts the temperature

**Celsius to Fahrenheit**
F = (C * 1.8 )+ 32


## Exit Quiz
- What is a variable and when is a good time to use them?
- Please provide examples of: a string, float, and integer
- Translate the following pseudocode into a JS or jQuery  if/else or if/else if/else statement:
  - define a variable called "temp"
  - if the variable "temp" is greater than 72 (integer or float), then output the following text as a **string**, "it is hot today"
  - otherwise, output the following text, "it is not hot today"

## Functions

Why?

---
*  You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
*  You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

Note: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp


## Functions
---
When?

---
- When you find yourself writing the same code over and over, except for one small difference
  - e.g. Microwaves allow users to heat items for various durations of time
  - We can structure a lot of our code in a similar fashion...to be reused in varous scenarios

## Return Functions
---
*  When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.
*  If the function was invoked from a statement, JavaScript will "return" to execute the code after the invoking statement.
*  Functions often compute a return value. The return value is "returned" back to the "caller":


## Return functions

*  We can use the output

```
   function returnThis(name){
    return name;
	}

	var returnedName = returnThis("Barry")

	console.log("hello"+returnedName);
```

## Anonymous Functions

*  Functions without a name
*  A very common use of anonymous functions is with __callbacks__
*  They are created at runtime, unlike **function declarations** which are run before any of the other code is executed
*  **Sequentially readable**, help keep the global namespace unpolluted
